# friction-coefficient

A simple C++ program for calculating the coefficient of friction (smaller for smoother surfaces).

Given the force applied to an object (in Newtons), the object's mass (in kilograms), and the object's acceleration (in m/s^2), this program will output the coefficient of friction.
